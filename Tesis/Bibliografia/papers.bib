abstract = {AbstractPrevious observational studies in the stable boundary layer diverge appreciably on the values of dimensionless ratios between turbulence-related quantities and on their stability dependence. In the present study, the hypothesis that such variability is caused by the influence of locally dependent nonturbulent processes, referred to as submeso, is tested and confirmed. This is done using six datasets collected at sites with different surface coverage. The time-scale dependence of wind components and temperature fluctuations is presented using the multiresolution decomposition, which allows the identification of the turbulence and submeso contributions to spectra and cospectra. In the submeso range, the spectra of turbulence kinetic energy range increases exponentially with time scale. The exponent decreases with the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations at a similar manner at all sites. This fact is used to determine the smaller time scale with relevant influence of submeso processes and a ratio that quantifies the relative importance of such nonturbulent processes with respect to turbulence. Based on that, values for the local stability parameter that are unaffected by nonturbulent processes are found. It is shown that the dimensionless ratios do not usually converge to a given value as the time scale increases and that it is as a consequence of the locally dependent submeso influence. The ratios and their stability dependence are determined at the time scales with least influence of nonturbulent processes, but significant site-to-site variability persists. Combining all datasets, expressions for the dependence of the dimensionless ratios on the local stability parameter that minimize the role of the submeso contribution are proposed.},

abstract = {In this work the dynamic behaviour of the wind in the nocturnal boundary layer is studied, with a particular focus on systematic behaviour of the near-surface wind. Recently, an extension of the well-known Blackadar model for frictionless inertial oscillations above the nocturnal boundary layer was proposed by Van deWiel et al., which accounts for frictional effects within the nocturnal boundary layer. It appears that the nocturnal wind velocity profile tends to perform an inertial oscillation around an equilibriumwind profile, rather than around the geostrophicwind vector (as in the Blackadar model). In thepresent studywepropose the conceptof ‘compositehodographs' to evaluate the ideas and assumptions of the aforementioned analytical model. Composite hodographs are constructed based on a large observational dataset from theCabauw observatory. For comparison and deeper analysis, this method is also applied to single-column model simulations that represent the same dataset. From this, it is shown that winds in the middle and upper part of the nocturnal boundary layer closely follow the dynamics predicted by the model byVan de Wiel et al. In contrast, the near-surface wind shows more complex behaviour that can be described by two different stages: (1) a decelerating phase where the wind decreases rapidly in magnitude due to enlarged stress divergence in the transition period near sunset (an aspect not included in the analytical model), and (2) a regular type of inertial oscillation, but with relatively small amplitude as compared to the oscillations in the middle and upper parts of the nocturnal boundary layer.},

abstract = {A climatology of nocturnal low-level jets (LLJs) is presented for the topographically flat measurement site at Cabauw, the Netherlands. LLJ characteristics are derived from a 7-yr half-hourly database of wind speed profiles, obtained from the 200-m mast and a wind profiler. Many LLJs at Cabauw originate from an inertial oscillation, which develops after sunset in a layer decoupled from the surface by stable stratification. The data are classified to different types of stable boundary layers by using the geostrophic wind speed and the isothermal net radiative cooling as classification parameters. For each of these classes, LLJ characteristics like frequency of occurrence, height above ground level, and the turning of the wind vector across the boundary layer are determined. It is found that LLJs occur in about 20{\%} of the nights, are typically situated at 140-260 m above ground level, and have a speed of 6-10 m s(-1). Development of a substantial LLJ is most likely to occur for moderate geostrophic forcing and a high radiative cooling. A comparison with the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) is added to illustrate how the results can be used to evaluate the performance of atmospheric models.},

abstract = {Air quality forecast systems need reliable and accurate representations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to perform well. An important question is how accurately numerical weather prediction models can reproduce conditions in diverse synoptic flow types. Here, observations from the summer 2014 HygrA-CD (Hygroscopic Aerosols to Cloud Droplets) experimental campaign are used to validate simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the complex, urban terrain of the Greater Athens Area. Three typical atmospheric flow types were identified during the 39-day campaign based on 2-day backward trajectories: Continental, Etesians, and Saharan. It is shown that the numerical model simulations differ dramatically depending on the PBL scheme, atmospheric dynamics, and meteorological parameter (e.g., 2-m air temperature). Eight PBL schemes from WRF version 3.4 are tested with daily simulations on an inner domain at 1-km grid spacing. Near-surface observations of 2-m air temperature and relative humidity and 10-m wind speed are collected from multiple meteorological stations. Estimates of the PBL height come from measurements using a multiwavelength Raman lidar, with an adaptive extended Kalman filter technique. Vertical profiles of atmospheric variables are obtained from radiosonde launches, along with PBL heights calculated using bulk Richardson number. Daytime maximum PBL heights ranged from 2.57 km during Etesian flows, to as low as 0.37 km during Saharan flows. The largest differences between model and observations are found with simulated PBL height during Saharan synoptic flows. During the daytime, campaign-averaged near-surface variables show WRF tended to have a cool, moist bias with higher simulated wind speeds than the observations, especially near the coast. It is determined that non-local PBL schemes give the most agreeable solutions when compared with observations.},

Heights were normalized by the height of the first LLJ maximum above the surface ZX, and the velocity scale used was the speed of the jet UX, which is shown to be superior to the friction velocity u* as a velocity scale. The major results were 1) the ratio of the maximum value of the streamwise standard deviation to the LLJ speed most common profile shapes had the maximum that were somewhat more stable had constant of the profiles had a maximum of u/UX was found to be 0.05, and 2) the three 2 u profile shapes were determined by stability (or Richardson number Ri).

Data on the height and speed of the LLJ maximum were available at high vertical and temporal resolution using the high-resolution Doppler lidar (HRDL).

abstract = {Low-level climatological wind fields over the La Plata River region of South America are synthesized with a dry, hydrostatic mesoscale boundary-layer numerical model. The model is forced at the upper boundary with the 1200 UTC local radiosonde observations and at the lower boundary with a land-river differential heating function defined from the daily meteorological observations of the region. The climatological wind field is defined as the mean value of a series of individual daily forecasts, employing two methods. The simplified method considers a 192-member ensemble (16 wind directions and 12 wind-speed classes at the upper boundary). Each member has a probability of occurrence that is determined from the 1959-1984 observations; the daily method uses a total of 3,248 days with available data during the same period. In both methods each realization is a daily forecast from which the mean wind distributions at 0300, 0900, 1500 and 2100 local standard time are calculated and compared to the observations of five meteorological stations in the region. The validation of the climatological wind fields for both methods is evaluated by means of the root-mean-square error of the wind-direction frequency distribution and mean wind speed by wind sector. The results obtained with the two methods are similar, and the errors in wind speed are always smaller than those in wind direction. The combined errors of wind direction and wind speed show that the ensemble method is outperformed by the daily method, on average by meteorological station in only one out of five of them, and on average by the time of the day in only one out of 4 h. The conclusion of the study is that the ensemble method is an appropriate methodology for determining high resolution, low-level climatological wind fields, with the boundary-layer model applied to a region with a strong diurnal cycle of surface thermal contrast. The proposed methodology is of particular utility for synthesizing wind fields over regions with limited meteorological observations, since the 192-member matrix can be easily defined with few observing points, as well as in the case of relatively incomplete records.

Southerly wind maxima appear on both morning and afternoon soundings but occur with much greater frequency, over a larger area, on the morning observations. Twenty-eight morning jet cases are used to determine average synoptic-scale wind and temperature patterns in the vicinity of the jet. Diurnal wind oscillations are examined by comparisons of jet frequencies, spceds, and altitudes on four-times-daily observations. The oscillation is similar t o that described by Blackadar; however, there is no apparent tendency for the latitudinal variation in period of the oscillation which Blackadar's model implies.},

The technique is an extension of ideas put foward by Probert-Jones, Lhermitte, Atlas, Caton and Harrold, and is based upon the Velocity-Azimuth Display (VAD) obtained by scanning the radar beam about vertical axis at a fixed elevation angle. Harmonic analysis of the VAD permits divergence to be obtained from the magnitude of the "zeroth" harmonic, wind speed and direction to be obtained from the amplitude and phase of the first harmonic, and resultant deformation and the axis of dilatation to be obtained from the amplitude and phase of the second harmonic. Althoug limitations to the accuracy of this technique are imposed by inhomogeneities in the horizontal distribution of precipitation fall speed and, in the presence of strong vertical wind shear, by elevation angle errors and reflectivity inhomogeneities, the errors resulting from these effects can be made acceptably small by scanning at appropriate elevation angles and ranges. An optimum scanning procedure is suggested. A short case study is also presented to support the view that meaningful estimates of mesoscale divergences and deformation can be obtained using this technique.},

abstract = {A long-term study of the turbulent structure of the convective boundary layer (CBL) at the U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Climate Research Facility is presented. Doppler velocity measurements from insects occupying the lowest 2 km of the boundary layer during summer months are used to map the vertical velocity component in the CBL. The observations cover four summer periods (2004-08) and are classified into cloudy and clear boundary layer conditions. Profiles of vertical velocity variance, skewness, and mass flux are estimated to study the daytime evolution of the convective boundary layer during these conditions. A conditional sampling method is applied to the original Doppler velocity dataset to extract coherent vertical velocity structures and to examine plume dimension and contribution to the turbulent transport. Overall, the derived turbulent statistics are consistent with previous aircraft and lidar observations. The observations provide unique insight into the daytime evolution of the convective boundary layer and the role of increased cloudiness in the turbulent budget of the subcloud layer. Coherent structures (plumes-thermals) are found to be responsible for more than 80{\%} of the total turbulent transport resolved by the cloud radar system. The extended dataset is suitable for evaluating boundary layer parameterizations and testing large-eddy simulations (LESs) for a variety of surface and cloud conditions.},

abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is deploying sensitive, millimeter-wave cloud radars at its Cloud and Radiation Test Bed (CART) sites in Oklahoma, Alaska, and the tropical western pacific Ocean. The radars complement optical devices, including a Belfort or Vaisala Laser ceilometer and a micropulse lidar, in providing a comprehensive source of information on the vertical distribution of hydrometeors overhead at the sites. An algorithm is described that combines data from these active remote sensors to produce an objective determination of hydrometeor height distributions and estimates of their radar reflectivities, vertical velocities, and Doppler spectral widths, which are optimized for accuracy. These data provide fundamental information for retrieving cloud microphysical properties and assessing the radiative effects of clouds on climate. The algorithm is applied to nine months of data from the CART site in Oklahoma for initial evaluation. Much of the algorithm's calculations deal with merging and optimizing data from the radar's four sequential operating modes, which have differing advantages and limitations, including problems resulting from range sidelobes, range aliasing, and coherent averaging. Two of rile modes use advanced phase-coded pulse compression techniques to yield approximately 10 and 15 dB more sensitivity than is available from the two conventional pulse modes. Comparison of cloud-base heights from the Belfort ceilometer and the micropulse lidar confirms small biases found in earlier studies, but recent information about the ceilometer brings the agreement to within 20-30 m. Merged data of the radar's modes were found to miss approximately 5.9{\%} of the clouds detected by the laser systems. Using data from only the radar's two less-sensitive conventional pulse modes would increase the missed detections to 22{\%}-34{\%}. A significant remaining problem is that the radar's lower-altitude data are often contaminated with echoes from nonhydrometeor targets, such as insects.},

The present model indicates that, for the pure Holton mechanism (time-independent friction coefficient), the maximum southerly wind speed occurs (depending on the assumed friction coefficient) between sunset and midnight local standard time, which is earlier than the observed after-midnight maximum. For the pure Blackadar mechanism (time-independent thermal forcing), the present model shows that generally occurs later (closer to sunrise) than observed and has a strong latitudinal dependence. For both mechanisms combined, the present model indicates that occurs near to the observed time, which lies between the time obtained in the pure Holton mechanism and ...},

@article{Dudhia1989,
abstract = {A two-dimensional version of the Pennsylvania State University mesoscale model has been applied to Winter Monsoon Experiment data in order to simulate the diurnally occurring convection observed over the South China Sea. The domain includes a representation of part of Borneo as well as the sea so that the model can simulate the initiation of convection. Also included in the model are parameterizations of mesoscale ice phase and moisture processes and longwave and shortwave radiation with a diurnal cycle. This allows use of the model to test the relative importance of various heating mechanisms to the stratiform cloud deck, which typically occupies several hundred kilometers of the domain. Frank and Cohen's cumulus parameterization scheme is employed to represent vital unresolved vertical transports in the convective area. The major conclusions are: 1.Ice phase processes are important in determining the level of maximum large-scale heating and vertical motion because there is a strong anvil component. The heating is initiated by a thermodynamic adjustment that takes place after the air leaves the updrafts and is associated with the difference between water and ice saturation. 2.Melting and evaporation contribute to a 1ocalized mesoscale subsidence in a 50 km region to the rear of the moving convective area. The cooling associated with this almost cancels the cumulus heating in the lower to midtroposphere. 3.Radiative heating was found to be the main ascent-forcing influence at high levels occupied by the widespread cirrus outflow. Additionally, radiative clear-air cooling helped the convection by continuously destabilizing the troposphere and countering the warming effect of convective updrafts. 4.The overall structure and development of the system were well simulated, particularly the growth near the coast, and the propagation and decay in the cooler boundary layer further off-shore, but the rainfall may have been underestimated because of the two-dimensional assumptions of the model.},

abstract = {Meteorologists have encountered problems with the Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD) algorithm in the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) System. Under certain meteorological conditions, forecasters have observed differences between the radar's wind profiles and wind profiles from rawinsonde upper-air soundings, or wind profilers. One of the main causes of this problem is inversions in the atmosphere which cause the radar beam to subrefract or superrefract, causing VAD winds to be inaccurately reported at a particular height. This thesis used the WSR-88D Algorithm Testing and Display System (WATADS) to compare VAD winds from recorded Level II NEXRAD data at Vandenberg AFB, CA, with rawinsonde wind data and wind profiler data also recorded from Vandenberg. Approximately two weeks of data from each season in which low-level inversions in the atmosphere were present were used in this research. The adaptable parameters of the VAD algorithm were modified to determine if the VAD winds reported by the WSR-88D could be improved. This research discovered that only modifying the VAD range adaptable parameter resulted in any significant improvement in the VAD winds. However, no single range value could be determined to work the best in all cases. The degree to which the range value optimizes the VAD winds is seasonally-dependent. Overall, changing the VAD range value during low-level inversions might improve the VAD winds at one height, but will probably cause the VAD winds at another height to be unreliable.},

abstract = {The velocity{\&}{\#}8211;azimuth display (VAD) technique was designed to estimate the areal mean vertical profile of the horizontal wind above a ground-based Doppler radar. The method uses radial velocity observations under the assumption of a linear wind field, though it encounters difficulty when the observations are contaminated by velocity ambiguities, large noise, and when viable data exist only over a restricted azimuthal range. The method suggested in this paper uses gradients of radial velocity, rather than only the velocity itself, to derive wind profiles and thus is termed the gradient velocity{\&}{\#}8211;azimuth display (GVAD) technique. Both the VAD and GVAD methods are tested first on simulated data to examine their sensitivity to different type of errors in radial velocity. The retrieved mean wind profiles are shown to be insensitive to random errors in radial velocity, even at large amplitude. However, the VAD method is very sensitive to systematic errors caused by velocity ambiguities. The experiments indicate that if only 3{\&}{\#}37; of a full-volume scan of radial wind data is contaminated by aliasing errors, the relative rms error in the mean wind profile retrieved by VAD can reach 50{\&}{\#}37;. In contrast, GVAD is very robust to such errors. Application of GVAD to Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data collected during the 3 May 1999 tornado outbreak show that it has the ability to obtain accurate wind profiles even when the observations contain large errors caused by velocity ambiguities and random noise.},

abstract = {/ Air pollution potential is a measure of the atmospheric conditions that are unable to transport and dilute pollutants into the air, independently of the existence of sources. This potential can be determined from two atmospheric parameters: mixing height and transport wind. In this paper a statistical analysis of the mixing height and transport wind, in order to determine the areas with high or poor atmospheric ventilation in Argentina, is presented. In order to achieve this, meteorological data registered during 1979-1982 at eight meteorological stations were used. Daily values of the maximum mixing height were calculated from observations of daily temperatures at different heights and maximum surface temperature. At the same time as the maximum mixing height, the values of the transport wind were determined from the surface windspeed and the characteristics of the ground in the surroundings of each meteorological station. The mean seasonal values for both parameters were obtained. Isopleths of the mean seasonal of the maximum mixing heights were drawn. The percentage of seasonal frequencies of poor ventilation conditions were calculated and the frequency isopleths were also drawn to determine areas with minor and major relative frequencies. It was found that the northeastern and central-eastern regions of Argentina had a high air pollution potential during the whole year. Unfavorable atmospheric ventilation conditions were also found in the central-western side of the country during the cold seasons (37.5{\%} in autumn and 56.9{\%} in winter). The region with the greatest atmospheric ventilation is located south of 40 degrees S, where the frequency of poor ventilation varies between 8.0{\%} in summer and 10.8{\%} in winter.},

abstract = {Doppler weather radar provides measurements of radial velocity. Such data are widely used for various applications, such as wind profile calculations with Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD) or Volume Velocity Processing (VVP) algorithms, wind shear detection, or numerical weather prediction model (NWP) assimilation. While precipitation can normally be regarded as tracer of the horizontal air flow, this is questionable for clear air radar returns from non-stationary targets, in particular from insects. Such insect echoes are common in European radar data during the summer season. In several publications, insects are considered being rather passive tracers which would justify taking their radial velocity data for true radial wind data (e.g. Wilson et al., 1994; Michelson and Seaman, 2000; Huuskonen at al., 2009). Other studies found that radial velocities should not be used for such purpose, i.e. insects cannot be generally considered as passive tracers (e.g. Achtemeyer, 1991; Rennie et al., 2010; Rennie, 2014; Melnikov et al., 2014). In these studies, insect data derived winds were usually compared with “true” wind data using NWP results or radiosonde data for comparison, leaving room for speculation about the accuracy of such comparisons. In this study, radar radial velocity data are compared with radial velocity data of an IR lidar co-located to the radar. The measurement setup and data processing are described in section 2. Results are presented in the sections thereafter.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a revised vertical diffusion package with a nonlocal turbulent mixing coefficient in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Based on the study of Noh et al. and accumulated results of the behavior of the Hong and Pan algorithm, a revised vertical diffusion algorithm that is suitable for weather forecasting and climate prediction models is developed. The major ingredient of the revision is the inclusion of an explicit treatment of entrainment processes at the top of the PBL. The new diffusion package is called the Yonsei University PBL (YSU PBL). In a one-dimensional offline test framework, the revised scheme is found to improve several features compared with the Hong and Pan implementation. The YSU PBL increases boundary layer mixing in the thermally induced free convection regime and decreases it in the mechanically induced forced convection regime, which alleviates the well-known problems in the Medium- Range Forecast (MRF) PBL. Excessive mixing in the mixed layer in the presence of strong winds is resolved. Overly rapid growth of the PBL in the case of the Hong and Pan is also rectified. The scheme has been successfully implemented in the Weather Research and Forecast model producing a more realistic structure of the PBL and its development. In a case study of a frontal tornado outbreak, it is found that some systematic biases of the large-scale features such as an afternoon cold bias at 850 hPa in the MRF PBL are resolved. Consequently, the new scheme does a better job in reproducing the convective inhibition. Because the convective inhibition is accurately predicted, widespread light precipitation ahead of a front, in the case of the MRF PBL, is reduced. In the frontal region, the YSU PBL scheme improves some characteristics, such as a double line of intense convection. This is because the boundary layer from the YSU PBL scheme remains less diluted by entrainment leaving more fuel for severe convection when the front triggers it.},

This study examines the sensitivity of the performance of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to the use of three different PBL schemes [Mellor?Yamada?Janjic (MYJ), Yonsei University (YSU), and the asymmetric convective model, version 2 (ACM2)]. Comparison of surface and boundary layer observations with 92 sets of daily, 36-h high-resolution WRF simulations with different schemes over Texas in July?September 2005 shows that the simulations with the YSU and ACM2 schemes give much less bias than with the MYJ scheme. Simulations with the MYJ scheme, the only local closure scheme of the three, produced the coldest and moistest biases in the PBL. The differences among the schemes are found to be due predominantly to differences in vertical mixing strength and entrainment of air from above the PBL. A sensitivity experiment with the ACM2 scheme confirms this diagnosis.},

abstract = {The step-mountain eta model has shown a surprising skill in forecasting severe storms. Much of the credit for this should be given to the Betts and Miller (hereafter referred to as BM) convection scheme and the Mellor-Yamada (hereafter referred to as MY) planetary boundary layer (PBL) formulation. However, the eta model was occasionally producing heavy spurious precipitation over warm water, as well as widely spread light precipitation over oceans. In addition, the convective forcing, particularly the shallow one, could lead to negative entropy changes. As the possible causes of the problems, the convection scheme, the processes at the air-water interface, and the MY level 2 and level 2.5 PBL schemes were reexamined. A major revision of the BM scheme was made, a new marine viscous sublayer scheme was designed, and the MY schemes were retuned. The deep convective regimes are postulated to be characterized by a parameter called “cloud efficiency.” The relaxation time is extended for low cloud efficiencies and vice versa. It is also postulated that there is a range of reference equilibrium states. The specific reference state is chosen depending on the cloud efficiency. The treatment of the shallow cloud tops was modified, and the shallow reference humidity profiles are specified requiring that the entropy change be nonnegative. Over the oceans there are two layers: (a) a viscous sublayer with the vertical transports determined by the molecular diffusion, and (b) a layer above it with the vertical transports determined by the turbulence. The viscous sublayer operates in different regimes depending on the roughness Reynolds number. The MY level 2.5 turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is initialized from above in the PBL, so that excessive TKE is dissipated at most places during the PBL spinup. The method for calculating the MY level 2.5 master length scale was rectified. To demonstrate the effects of the new schemes for the deep convection and the viscous sublayer, tests were made using two summer cases: one with heavy spurious precipitation, and another with a successful 36-h forecast of a tropical storm. The new schemes had dramatic positive impacts on the case with the spurious precipitation. The results were also favorable in the tropical storm case. The developments presented here were incorporated into the eta model in 1990. The details of further research will be reported elsewhere. The eta model became operational at the National Meteorological Center, Washington, D.C., in June 1993.},

In contrast, the long-lasting wintertime jets do not have any clear diurnal variability. The urban environment strongly influences LLJs in both seasons: above the city LLJs are higher, weaker and observed more rarely than at the rural site. In very cold periods (air temperature below -8A degrees C) no LLJs were observed over the city, instead convection emerged in the urban boundary layer.

The Mobile Integrated Profiling System (MIPS) and the Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching Radar (SMART-R) were collocated at the western Florida coastline near Venice, very close to the wind center at landfall. Prior to landfall, the boundary layer was rendered weakly stable by a long period of evaporational cooling and mesoscale downdrafts within extensive stratiform precipitation that started 18 h before landfall. The cool air mass was expansive, with an area within the 23°C surface isotherm of about 50 000 km2. East-northeasterly surface flow transported this cool air off the west coast of Florida, toward the convergent warm core of the Gabrielle, and promoted the development of shallow warm and cold fronts that were prominent during the landfall phase.

abstract = {Boundary layer rolls over Lake Michigan have been observed in wintertime conditions predicted by many past studies to favor nonroll convective structures (such as disorganized convection or cellular convection). This study examines mechanisms that gave rise to transitions between boundary layer rolls and more cellular convective structures observed during a lake-effect snow event over Lake Michigan on 17 December 1983. The purposes of this study are to better understand roll formation in marine boundary layers strongly heated from below and examine the evolution of snowfall rate and mass overturning rate within the boundary layer during periods of convective transition. A method of quantifying the uniformity of convection along the roll axes, based on dual-Doppler radar-derived vertical motions, was developed to quantify changes in boundary layer convective structure. Roll formation was found to occur after (within 1 h) increases in low-level wind speeds and speed shear primarily below about 0.32z(i), with little change in directional shear within the convective boundary layer. Roll convective patterns appeared to initiate upstream of the sample region, rather than form locally near the downwind shore of Lake Michigan. These findings suggest that either rolls developed over the upwind half of Lake Michigan or that the convection had a delayed response to changes in the atmospheric surface and wind forcing. Mass overturning rates at midlevels in the boundary layer peaked when rolls were dominant and gradually decreased when cellular convection became more prevalent. Radar-estimated aerial-mean snowfall rates showed little relationship with changes in convective structure. However, when rolls were dominant, the heaviest snow was more concentrated in updraft regions than during more cellular time periods.},

The innovative aspect of the algorithm is that it dealiases Doppler velocity at each grid point independently by using three-dimensional wind fields obtained either from an objective analysis using conventional observations and mesoscale model output or from a rapidly updated analysis of VDRAS that assimilates radar data. This algorithm consists of three steps: preserving horizontal shear, global dealiasing using reference wind from the objective analysis or the VDRAS analysis, and local dealiasing. It is automated and intended to be used operationally for radar data assimilation using numerical weather prediction models. The algorithm was tested with 384 volumes of radar data observed from the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) for a severe thunderstorm that occurred during 15 June 2002. It showed that the algorithm was effective in dealiasing large areas of aliased velocities when the wind from the objective analysis was used as the reference and that more accurate dealiasing was achieved by using the continuously cycled VDRAS analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract A simple new analysis method for large single-Doppler radar datasets is presented, using data from several tropical field experiments. A cylindrical grid is chosen, to respect both the geophysical importance of altitude and the radar importance of range and azimuth. Horizontal and temporal fine structure are sacrificed, by compiling data as hourly histograms in 12 ? 24 ? 36 spatial grid cells of 15° azimuth ? 8 km horizontal range ? 500 m height, respectively. Mean Doppler radial velocity in each region is automatically unfolded (dealiased) using a simple histogram method, and fed into a velocity?azimuth display (VAD) analysis. The result is a set of hourly horizontal wind and wind divergence profiles, with associated error estimates, for circles of different radii centered on the radar. These divergence profiles contain useful heating profile information in many weather situations, not just occasional cases of uniform widespread rainfall. Consistency of independent estimates for concentric circles, continuity from hour to hour, and good mass balance indicate high-quality results in one 48-h example sequence shown, from the East Pacific Investigations of Climate (EPIC 2001) experiment. Linear regression of divergence profiles versus reflectivity-estimated surface rain rates is used to illustrate the dominant systematic pattern: convective rain with low-level wind convergence evolves into stratiform rain with middle-level convergence, on a characteristic time scale of several hours. Absolute estimates of moisture convergence per unit of Z?R calculated rainfall vary strongly among experiments, in ways that appear to indicate reflectivity calibration errors. This indicates that Doppler data may offer a useful and unique bulk constraint on rainfall estimation by radar.},

A water-earth breeze at the maximum temperature hour could influence the mixing layer in this season. No effect was observed in winter. The influence of the wind direction on the mixing height has also been studied. In summer, mixing heights between 400 and 1600 m were more frequent when the wind came from N-E, than when it came from S-W, for Aeroparque. Far from the coastline this difference decreased.

abstract = {A rapid and accurate radiative transfer model (RRTM) for climate applications has been developed and the results extensively evaluated. The current version of RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates for the longwave spectral region (10–3000 cm−1) for an arbitrary clear atmosphere. The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated-k method: the k distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line-by-line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high-resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated-k approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m−2 (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10–3000 cm−1) error of less than 1.0 W m−2 at any altitude; 0.07 K d−1 for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d−1 in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m−2, an error of less than 5{\%}. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.},

abstract = {Abstract The modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer during convective conditions has long been a major source of uncertainty in the numerical modeling of meteorological conditions and air quality. Much of the difficulty stems from the large range of turbulent scales that are effective in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Both small-scale turbulence that is subgrid in most mesoscale grid models and large-scale turbulence extending to the depth of the CBL are important for the vertical transport of atmospheric properties and chemical species. Eddy diffusion schemes assume that all of the turbulence is subgrid and therefore cannot realistically simulate convective conditions. Simple nonlocal closure PBL models, such as the Blackadar convective model that has been a mainstay PBL option in the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University?National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) for many years and the original asymmetric convective model (ACM), also an option in MM5, represent large-scale transport driven by convective plumes but neglect small-scale, subgrid turbulent mixing. A new version of the ACM (ACM2) has been developed that includes the nonlocal scheme of the original ACM combined with an eddy diffusion scheme. Thus, the ACM2 is able to represent both the supergrid- and subgrid-scale components of turbulent transport in the convective boundary layer. Testing the ACM2 in one-dimensional form and comparing it with large-eddy simulations and field data from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere?Surface Exchange Study demonstrates that the new scheme accurately simulates PBL heights, profiles of fluxes and mean quantities, and surface-level values. The ACM2 performs equally well for both meteorological parameters (e.g., potential temperature, moisture variables, and winds) and trace chemical concentrations, which is an advantage over eddy diffusion models that include a nonlocal term in the form of a gradient adjustment.},

abstract = {The assimilation of Doppler radar radial winds for high resolution NWP may improve short term forecasts of convective weather. Using insects as the radar target, it is possible to provide wind observations during convective development. This study aims to explore the potential of these new observations, with three case studies. Radial winds from insects detected by 4 operational weather radars were assimilated using 3D-Var into a 1.5 km resolution version of the Met Office Unified Model, using a southern UK domain and no convective parameterization. The effect on the analysis wind was small, with changes in direction and speed up to 45° and 2 m s−1 respectively. The forecast precipitation was perturbed in space and time but not substantially modified. Radial wind observations from insects show the potential to provide small corrections to the location and timing of showers but not to completely relocate convergence lines. Overall, quantitative analysis indicated the observation impact in the three case studies was small and neutral. However, the small sample size and possible ground clutter contamination issues preclude unequivocal impact estimation. The study shows the potential positive impact of insect winds; future operational systems using dual polarization radars which are better able to discriminate between insects and clutter returns should provided a much greater impact on forecasts.},

abstract = {Insect returns from the UK's Doppler weather radars were collected in the summers of 2007 and 2008, to ascertain their usefulness in providing information about boundary layer winds. Such observations could be assimilated into numerical weather prediction models to improve forecasts of convective showers before precipitation begins. Significant numbers of insect returns were observed during daylight hours on a number of days through this period, when they were detected at up to 30 km range from the radars, and up to 2 km above sea level. The range of detectable insect returns was found to vary with time of year and temperature. There was also a very weak correlation with wind speed and direction. Use of a dual-polarized radar revealed that the insects did not orient themselves at random, but showed distinct evidence of common orientation on several days, sometimes at an angle to their direction of travel. Observation minus model background residuals of wind profiles showed greater bias and standard deviation than that of other wind measurement types, which may be due to the insects' headings/airspeeds and to imperfect data extraction. The method used here, similar to the Met Office's procedure for extracting precipitation returns, requires further development as clutter contamination remained one of the largest error contributors. Wind observations derived from the insect returns would then be useful for data assimilation applications. Copyright � 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.},

Using the radial velocity, the average orientation and direction of travel of the insects were determined. Common orientation was most clearly observed shortly before or after dawn, and occasionally in the evening. However, signs of orientation were observed in different migrant populations throughout the day. The cases selected for this study described a daily cycle of migration phases and associated atmospheric conditions. The weather was characterized using surface observations, analysis charts and numerical weather prediction model fields. Migrating insects were profuse during convective weather.

abstract = {This study investigates the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) technique in the diurnally varying atmospheric boundary layer in conditions of realistic environmental forcing. The initial settings of meteorological fields are obtained by 'ingesting' into the LES domain the vertical profiles of wind, temperature and specific humidity provided by the meteorological model WRF. The surface values of potential temperature and specific humidity from the WRF simulation are used as forcing parameters for the LES runs. These forcing parameters are updated during the runs every 1 h. A methodology is developed to derive the components of the geostrophic wind profile that is used in LES to model the large-scale horizontal mean pressure gradient and treated as an external forcing. This methodology involves the meteorological model WRF. In this context, the WRF model has a dual task: (1) providing realistic atmospheric environmental forcings to LES and (2) providing a very large dataset to investigate possible improvements of the LES setting to make the numerical prediction more realistic. The principal results obtained by the present study is that the use of geostrophic wind shear profiles improves the prognostic capability of LES in reproducing the wind field pattern in the planetary boundary layer, this is an important parameter for the proper description of the decay of the turbulent kinetic energy at sunset. {\textcopyright} 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The Weather and Research Forecast model is tested over South America in different configurations to identify the one that gives the best estimates of observed surface variables. Systematic, nonsystematic, and total errors are computed for 48-h forecasts initialized with the NCEP Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). There is no unique model design that best fits all variables over the whole domain, and nonsystematic errors for all configurations differ little from one another; such differences are in most cases smaller than the observed day-to-day variability. An ensemble mean consisting of runs with different parameterizations gives the best skill for the whole domain. Surface variables are highly sensitive to the choice of land surface models. Surface temperature is well represented by the Noah land model, but dewpoint temperature is best estimated by the simplest land surface model considered here, which specifies soil moisture based on climatology. This underlines the need for better understanding of humid processes at the subgrid scale. Surface wind errors decrease the intensity of the low-level jet, reducing expected heat and moisture advection over southeast South America (SESA), with negative precipitation errors over SESA and positive biases over the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ). This pattern of errors suggests feedbacks between wind errors, precipitation, and surface processes as follows: an increase of precipitation over the SACZ produces compensating descent in SESA, with more stable stratification, less rain, less soil moisture, and decreased rain. This is a clear example of how local errors are related to regional circulation, and suggests that improvement of model performance requires not only better parameterizations at the subgrid scales, but also improved regional models.},

The jet is modelled as a transient one-dimensional boundary-layer phenomenon, with the release of frictional constraint emulated by an impulsively reduced mixing coefficient (eddy viscosity). Prior to the reduction, the flow is in an equilibrium state described by the classical steady-state Ekman solution. The dimensional parameters of the transient problem are the Coriolis parameter, the post- and pre-sunset eddy viscosities, and an imposed pressure gradient force. The corresponding non-dimensional problem is governed by a single parameter, the ratio of the post- and pre-sunset mixing coefficients. The solution is obtained by the method of Laplace transforms.

By estimating the upper limit of the retrieval error and analyzing the effects of neglected parameters on retrieval accuracy, the simplified wind model is found to decrease the difficulty in solving and stabilizing the retrieval results, even though model errors would be induced by neglecting partial parameters. Strong linear correlation amongCM vectors would cause an ill-conditioned matrix when more parameters are selected. By using exact coordinate data and changing the size of the analysis volume, the variation of the condition number indicates that a large volume size decreases the condition number, and the decrease caused by increasing the number of volume gates is larger than that caused by increasing the sector width. Using the spread of errors in the solution, a demonstration using mathematical deduction is provided to explain how a large analysis volume can improve retrieval accuracy. A test with a uniform wind field is used to demonstrate these conclusions. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

The five schemes include two first-order closure schemes—the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL and Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2), and three turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) closure schemes—the Mellor–Yamada–Janji{\'{c}} (MYJ), quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE), and Bougeault–Lacarr{\'{e}}re (BouLac) PBL. The comparison results reveal that discrepancies among thermodynamic surface variables from different schemes are large at daytime, while the variables converge at nighttime with large deviations from those observed. On the other hand, wind components are more divergent at nighttime with significant biases. Regarding PBL structures, a non-local scheme with the entrainment flux proportional to the surface flux is favourable in unstable conditions. In stable conditions, the local TKE closure schemes show better performance. The sensitivity of simulated variables to surface-layer parametrizations is also investigated to assess relative contributions of the surface-layer parametrizations to typical features of each PBL scheme. In the surface layer, temperature and moisture are more strongly influenced by surface-layer formulations than by PBL mixing algorithms in both convective and stable regimes, while wind speed depends on vertical diffusion formulations in the convective regime. Regarding PBL structures, surface-layer formulations only contribute to near-surface variability and then PBL mean properties, whereas shapes of the profiles are determined by PBL mixing algorithms.},

abstract = {Part of the excitement in boundary-layer meteorology is the challenge associated with turbulent flow - one of the unsolved problems in classical physics. An additional attraction of the filed is the rich diversity of topics and research methods that are collected under the umbrella-term of boundary-layer meteorology. The flavor of the challenges and the excitement associated with the study of the atmospheric boundary layer are captured in this textbook. Fundamental concepts and mathematics are presented prior to their use, physical interpretations of the terms in equations are given, sample data are shown, examples are solved, and exercises are included.The work should also be considered as a major reference and as a review of the literature, since it includes tables of parameterizatlons, procedures, filed experiments, useful constants, and graphs of various phenomena under a variety of conditions. It is assumed that the work will be used at the beginning graduate level for students with an undergraduate background in meteorology, but the author envisions, and has catered for, a heterogeneity in the background and experience of his readers.},

It is experimentally determined from observational data of the wind profile in neutral conditions. However, there is evidence of dependence with changes in stability. Under the assumptions of the theory of Monin-Obukhov, the variability of the roughness parameter with atmospheric stability was studied from wind profiles observed over a vegetated surface. Empirical expressions for estimating the roughness length variability depending on the stability were obtained. Results showed that in stable condition the roughness length can fluctuate up to two orders of magnitude, whereas in unstable conditions variability was smaller. In addition, the impact of the dependence upon stability of this parameter was studied in a weather processor for contaminant diffusion. The results have a direct impact on the wind field near surface.},

abstract = {In the present work Blackadar's concept of nocturnal inertial oscillations is extended. Blackadar's concept describes frictionless inertial oscillations above the nocturnal inversion layer. The current work includes frictional effects within the nocturnal boundary layer. It is shown that the nocturnal wind speed profile de-scribes an oscillation around the nocturnal equilibrium wind vector, rather than around the geostrophic wind vector (as in the Blackadar case). By using this perspective, continuous time-dependent wind profiles are predicted. As such, information on both the height and the magnitude of the nocturnal low-level jet is available as a function of time. Preliminary analysis shows that the proposed extension performs well in comparison with observations when a simple Ekman model is used to represent the equilibrium state in combination with a realistic initial velocity profile. In addition to jet dynamics, backward inertial oscillations are predicted at lower levels close to the surface, which also appear to be present in observations. The backward oscillation forms an important mechanism behind weakening low-level winds during the afternoon transition. Both observational and theoretical modeling studies are needed to explore this phenomenon further.},

abstract = {A regional climate model is used to simulate boundary layer stratocumulus (Sc) clouds over the southeast Pacific off South America during August-October 1999 and to study their dynamical, radiative, and microphysical properties and their interaction with large-scale dynamic fields. Part I evaluates the model performance against satellite observations and examines physical processes important for maintaining the temperature inversion and Sc clouds in the simulation. The model captures major features of the marine boundary layer in the region, including a well-mixed marine boundary layer, a capping temperature inversion, Sc clouds, and the diurnal cycle. The Sc clouds develop in the lower half of and below the temperature inversion layer that increases its height westward off the Pacific coast of South America. The strength of the capping inversion is determined not only by large-scale subsidence and local sea surface temperature (SST), but also by cloud-radiation feedback. A heat budget analysis indicates that upward longwave radiation strongly cools the upper part of the cloud layer and strengthens the temperature inversion. This cloud-top cooling further induces a local enhancement of subsidence in and below the inversion layer, resulting in a dynamical warming that strengthens the temperature stratification above the clouds. While of secondary importance on the mean, solar radiation drives a pronounced diurnal cycle in the model boundary layer. Consistent with observations, boundary layer clouds thicken after sunset and cloud liquid water content reaches a maximum at 0600 local time just before the sunrise.},

abstract = {A realistic reproduction of planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure and its evolution is critical to numerical simulation of regional meteorology and air quality. Conversely, insufficient realism in the simulated physical properties often leads to degraded meteorological and air quality prognostic skills. This study employed the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to evaluate model performance and to quantify meteorological prediction differences produced by four widely used PBL schemes. Evaluated were two nonlocal PBL schemes, YSU and ACM2, and two local PBL schemes, MYJ and Boulac. The model grid comprised four nested domains at horizontal resolutions of 27 km, 9 km, 3 km and 1 km respectively. Simulated surface variables 2 m temperature and 10 m wind at 1 km resolution were compared to measurements collected in Hong Kong. A detailed analysis of land-atmosphere energy balance explicates heat flux and temperature variability among the PBL schemes. Differences in vertical profiles of horizontal velocity, potential temperature, bulk Richardson number and water vapor mixing ratio were examined. Diagnosed PBL heights, estimated by scheme specific formulations, exhibited the large intrascheme variance. To eliminate formulation dependence in PBL height estimation, lidar measurements and a unified diagnosis were jointly used to reanalyze PBL heights. The diagnosis showed that local PBL schemes produced shallower PBL heights than those of nonlocal PBL schemes. It is reasonable to infer that WRF, coupled with the ACM2 PBL physics option can be a viable producer of meteorological forcing to regional air quality modeling in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) Region.},

In this article, the AR-VAD analysis is further developed into a two-step alias-robust variational analysis, called AR-Var, to estimate the radial-velocity field beyond the VAD uniform-wind model from raw aliased radial-velocity observations on each range circle. In the first step, the original AR-VAD analysis is modified to fit the raw aliased radial-velocity observations around each of the two zero radial-velocity points on the selected range circle. The two analyzed radial-velocity fields are then combined into a single radial-velocity field not rigidly constrained by the VAD uniform-wind assumption. This combined radial-velocity field represents an improved fit to the observations over the entire range circle and thus can be used as the first-guess background to refine and perform the AR-Var analysis in the second step. The two-step AR-Var analysis can provide a reliable reference radial-velocity field for the reference check in radar velocity de-aliasing even when the Nyquist velocity is reduced below 12 m s−1, and this is illustrated by both idealized and real examples.},

abstract = {When the horizontal vector wind is estimated by the traditional velocity azimuth display (VAD) analysis from radar radial-velocity observations on a selected range circle, the observations should be thoroughly de-aliased first. When the effect of aliasing is formulated into the cost function, the VAD analysis can be applied to raw aliased radial-velocity observations, but the minimization problem for the VAD fitting is complicated by the multiple local minima caused by the zigzagdiscontinuities of the aliasing operator. An efficient two-step VAD algorithm is thus developed in this paper to find the global minimum in properly transformed subspaces of the VAD wind parameters. The algorithm is then extended into a three-step volume velocity processing (VVP) method to estimate the vertical profile of horizontal winds from each volume of radar radial-velocity scans. Examples are presented to illustrate the capability and robustness of the method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new velocity azimuth display (VAD)-based dealiasing method developed for automated radar radial velocity data quality control to satisfy the high-quality standard and efficiency required by operational radar data assimilation. The method is built on an alias-robust velocity azimuth display (AR-VAD) analysis. It upgrades and simplifies the previous three-step dealiasing method in three major aspects. First, the AR-VAD is used with sufficiently stringent threshold conditions in place of the original modified VAD for the preliminary reference check to produce alias-free seed data in the first step. Second, the AR-VAD is more accurate than the traditional VAD for the refined reference check in the original second step, so the original second step becomes unnecessary and is removed. Third, a block-to-point continuity check procedure is developed, in place of the point-to-point continuity check in the original third step, which serves to enhance the use of the available seed data in a properly enlarged block area around each flagged data point that is being checked with multiple threshold conditions to avoid false dealiasing. The new method has been tested extensively with aliased radial velocity data collected under various weather conditions, including hurricane high-wind conditions. The robustness of the new method is exemplified by the results tested with three cases. The limitations of the new method and possible improvements are discussed.},

abstract = {Although most of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations have demonstrated the capability to reproduce many meteorological phenomena in the lowest few kilometers, little attention has been paid to the prediction of the diurnal cycles of surface wind speed (VSFC) in relation to surface temperature (TSFC). In this study, the performance of five widely used PBL parameterizations in reproducing the diurnal cycles of VSFC and TSFC is evaluated using the 3-day mesoscale simulations of summertime weak-gradient flows over the central United States where little organized convection and topographical forcing were present. The time series of area-averaged VSFC and TSFC, as well as the vertical wind and thermal profiles from the five sensitivity simulations, are compared with hourly surface observations and other available data. The hourly surface observations reveal that the diurnal cycles of VSFC are in phase (but surface wind directions are 5–6 h out of phase) with those of TSFC. It is shown that both VSFC and TSFC are very sensitive to the PBL parameterizations, given the identical conditions for all of the other model parameters. It is found that all five of the PBL schemes can reproduce the diurnal phases of TSFC (and wind directions), albeit with different amplitudes. However, all of the schemes underestimate the strength of VSFC during the daytime, and most of them overestimate it at night. Moreover, some PBL schemes produce pronounced phase errors in VSFC or substantially weak VSFC all of the time, despite their well-simulated diurnal cycle of TSFC. The results indicate that a perfect simulation of the diurnal TSFC cycle (and the thermal structures above) does not guarantee the reproduction of the diurnal cycles of VSFC. The final outcome would depend on how various physical processes, such as the vertical turbulent exchanges of the mass and momentum under different stability conditions, are parameterized. Because the upper portion of the PBL flow is often nearly opposite in phase to VSFC under weak-gradient conditions, the results have significant implications for the predictability of diurnal precipitation and the studies of air quality, wind energy, and other environmental problems.},
